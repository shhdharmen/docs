## Overview
Templates describe the shape of your project's documents that can be created on the dashboard and served from the API.


Templates can only be created and modified from within a [tipe config file](https://tipe/docs/reference/config). This means that no one on the Tipe dashboard can make changes to the templates causing unwanted side effects or even breaking your production app.
