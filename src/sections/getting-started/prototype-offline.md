## Prototype with the offline mock API
The Tipe CLI comes with an offline API that generates mock content based on your templates. Its great for prototyping your templates to get them just right. You also aren't stuck waiting on your content team to create content just so you can build your app.

**Start the offline API**
```
tipe serve
```
